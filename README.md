## Overview

General-purpose, reusable Windows scripting tooling for automated Hyper-V VM
provisioning. Not specific to any single project — intended to be consumed by
other projects that need self-hosted infrastructure.

Automates creation and removal of Hyper-V VMs on Windows 11, with Ubuntu
installed and a default user configured via cloud-init. All parameters are
stored in an AES-256 encrypted local vault scoped to the Windows user account
— nothing sensitive is committed to the repo.

---

## Requirements

PowerShell 7+ (`pwsh`). Windows PowerShell 5.1 is not supported.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Windows 11 with Hyper-V enabled, PowerShell 7+, and
Administrator privileges. WSL2 is installed automatically by `provision.ps1`
on first run if not already present (a reboot may be required).
`Infrastructure.Common` and `Infrastructure.Secrets` are installed from
PSGallery automatically on first run.

```powershell
# 1. Store config in the local vault (once per machine)
.\hyper-v\ubuntu\setup-secrets.ps1 -ConfigFile C:\private\vm-config.json

# 2. Provision VMs (run as Administrator)
.\hyper-v\ubuntu\provision.ps1

# 3. Remove VMs when no longer needed (run as Administrator)
.\hyper-v\ubuntu\deprovision.ps1
```

---

## setup-secrets.ps1

Run once per machine before `provision.ps1`.

```powershell
# Recommended: read config from a file outside the repo
.\setup-secrets.ps1 -ConfigFile C:\private\vm-config.json

# Optional: require a vault-level password on top of Windows user scope
.\setup-secrets.ps1 -ConfigFile C:\private\vm-config.json -RequireVaultPassword
```

Installs `Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement` and
`Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore` if missing, registers the `VmProvisioner`
vault, validates the JSON, and stores it as the `VmProvisionerConfig` secret.
Re-running safely updates the stored config.

**Config file format** — a JSON array, one object per VM:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "vmName":        "ubuntu-01-ci",
    "cpuCount":      2,
    "ramGB":         4,
    "diskGB":        40,
    "ubuntuVersion": "24.04",
    "username":      "u-01-admin",
    "password":      "...",
    "ipAddress":     "192.168.1.101",
    "subnetMask":    "24",
    "gateway":       "192.168.1.1",
    "dns":           "8.8.8.8",
    "vmConfigPath":  "E:\\a_VMs\\Hyper-V\\Config",
    "vhdPath":       "E:\\a_VMs\\Hyper-V\\Disks"
  }
]
```

All fields are required. After first boot, connect via `ssh username@ipAddress`.

| Field           | Type   | Description                                        |
|-----------------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `vmName`        | string | Name in Hyper-V and as the VM's hostname           |
| `cpuCount`      | int    | Number of virtual processors                       |
| `ramGB`         | int    | RAM in GB (static allocation)                      |
| `diskGB`        | int    | OS disk size in GB                                 |
| `ubuntuVersion` | string | Ubuntu release, e.g. `"24.04"`                     |
| `username`      | string | OS user created by cloud-init on first boot        |
| `password`      | string | Password for that user (plain text in vault only)  |
| `ipAddress`     | string | Static IPv4 address assigned inside the VM         |
| `subnetMask`    | string | CIDR prefix length, e.g. `"24"`                    |
| `gateway`       | string | Default gateway — also assigned to the host vNIC   |
| `dns`           | string | DNS server IP                                      |
| `vmConfigPath`  | string | Windows path where seed ISO is written             |
| `vhdPath`       | string | Windows path where VHDX files are stored           |
| `switchName`    | string | Hyper-V Internal switch name. Default: `VmLAN`     |
| `natName`       | string | Windows NAT rule name. Default: `VmLAN-NAT`        |
| `javaDevKit`    | object? | Optional. Installs a JDK system-wide on first boot. See [Optional: install a JDK](#optional-install-a-jdk). |
| `files`         | array?  | Optional. Copies arbitrary host files onto the VM. See [Optional: copy files to the VM](#optional-copy-files-to-the-vm). |

### Optional: install a JDK

Add a `javaDevKit` object to any VM entry to install a JDK system-wide on
first boot. When absent, no JDK is installed and the rest of provisioning is
unaffected.

```jsonc
{
  "vmName": "dev-01",
  "...":    "...",
  "javaDevKit": {
    "vendor":  "temurin",
    "version": "21"
  }
}
```

| Sub-field | Required | Allowed values                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `vendor`  | yes      | `temurin` (Adoptium Temurin — currently the only supported vendor). |
| `version` | yes      | A **string** in one of four granularities (see below).         |

Version-string granularities — pick the level of pinning that suits you:

| Example         | Meaning                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `"21"`          | Latest GA of feature release 21                  |
| `"21.0"`        | Latest GA on the 21.0 line                       |
| `"21.0.5"`      | Latest build of 21.0.5                           |
| `"21.0.5+11"`   | Exact build, no resolution                       |

`version` must be a JSON string. Numeric values like `21` are rejected so that
`"21.0"` cannot silently degrade to `21` through trailing-zero loss, and so
that `"21.0.5+11"` (not a valid JSON number) follows the same rule as the
other granularities.

At provision time the requested granularity is resolved against the
[Adoptium v3 API](https://api.adoptium.net/q/swagger-ui/) to a concrete build
(for example `"21"` -> `21.0.6+7`) along with its SHA-256 and download URL.
The resolved build is then pinned in a host-side lockfile next to the cached
tarball so subsequent provisioning runs reuse the exact same bytes — no
silent upgrades between runs.

**Cache artifacts** — written into `vhdPath` (same directory as the cached
Ubuntu VHDX):

| File                                                | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `jdk-{vendor}-{requestedVersion}-linux-x64.tar.gz`  | The Temurin tarball, keyed by the requested (not resolved) version.     |
| `jdk-{vendor}-{requestedVersion}-linux-x64.lock.json` | Sidecar pin recording `resolvedVersion`, `sha256`, `sourceUrl`, and download timestamp. |

The cache key uses the **requested** version, so two VMs that both ask for
`"21"` share one cache slot. The lockfile is authoritative on subsequent
runs — the resolver is not re-invoked — so a `"21"` request cannot silently
upgrade to a newer build between provisionings.

To invalidate the pin:

- **Delete the lockfile** to force re-resolution against the live Adoptium
  API on the next run (use this to pull in a newer build for a coarse
  request like `"21"`).
- **Delete only the tarball** to trigger a self-heal redownload of the
  exact build the lockfile pinned to (useful when the cached file is
  corrupt but the pin is still wanted).

Neither file is committed — the cache lives entirely on the host, same
trust model as the cached Ubuntu VHDX.

**On the VM** — after the VM is up and cloud-init has finished, the
post-provisioning orchestrator pushes the cached tarball over its
already-open SSH session via the host file server (the same mechanism
`Infrastructure-GitHubRunners` uses to ship the actions-runner binary).
The `Install-Jdk` step then streams the tarball through `tar` directly
into the install directory (no intermediate file on the VM disk) and
writes a system-wide environment script:

| Location                              | Purpose                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/opt/jdk-{vendor}-{resolvedVersion}/` | Install root. Path embeds the *resolved* build so coexisting installs do not collide if the requested version is later bumped. |
| `/etc/profile.d/jdk.sh`               | Exports `JAVA_HOME` and prepends `$JAVA_HOME/bin` to `PATH`. Sourced by every login shell automatically. |

The install runs **out-of-band**, not via cloud-init `runcmd`. cloud-init's
job is to bootstrap the OS; the provisioner installs optional software.
Same pattern as the runner install in Infrastructure-GitHubRunners. This
keeps the seed ISO's lifecycle short (it carries the plaintext admin
password and is detached as soon as SSH is reachable) and avoids putting
cloud-init stage knowledge into the host provisioner.

Because the export script lives under `/etc/profile.d/`, any user account
later created on the VM — including those provisioned by
[Infrastructure-Vm-Users](https://github.com/VitaliiAndreev/Infrastructure-Vm-Users) —
sees `JAVA_HOME` and `java` on `PATH` without any additional configuration
in that repo. This is the deliberate split of responsibilities: the
provisioner owns "software the box needs"; Vm-Users owns identities.

The extraction step is idempotent — if the install directory's `release`
file already exists, re-runs of `provision.ps1` are a no-op for the JDK
step.

### Optional: copy files to the VM

Add a `files` array to any VM entry to copy arbitrary host files onto the
VM after cloud-init finishes. Each entry is a `{ source, target }` pair —
local Windows path on the host, absolute Linux path on the VM.

```jsonc
{
  "vmName": "dev-01",
  "...":    "...",
  "files": [
    { "source": "C:\\jars\\mylib-1.0.jar", "target": "/opt/lib/mylib-1.0.jar" },
    { "source": "C:\\fixtures\\seed.json", "target": "/var/data/seed.json" }
  ]
}
```

| Sub-field | Required | Notes                                                                  |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `source`  | yes      | Windows path. **Must exist at validation time** — typos fail before any VM work begins. |
| `target`  | yes      | Absolute Linux path on the VM (must start with `/`). Parent directory is created if absent. |

The copy is performed over the same SSH session and host file server used
by other post-provisioning steps (see [provision.ps1](#provisionps1) step
10). The actual file transfer is delegated to
`Infrastructure.HyperV`'s `Copy-VmFiles` cmdlet — the validator that
backs the schema (`Assert-VmFilesField`) also lives there. Both are
reused by `Infrastructure-Vm-Users` for its own (user-owned) file copies.
Re-runs overwrite the target file with the current host source —
the user's intent is "this file should look like this".

**Ownership model in the provisioner**: every file copied by this step
lands `root:root, 0644`. The provisioner runs *before* user creation, so
no app users exist yet to chown to. Files needing a per-user owner belong
in `Infrastructure-Vm-Users`'s `files` array, which runs after that step
creates the users.

`files` is **purely user data** — no install step (JDK, future Maven, …)
reads from these paths. Each install is self-contained. This keeps the
contract simple: the user owns the target paths and what lives there.

---

## provision.ps1

Run as Administrator after `setup-secrets.ps1` has stored the config.

```powershell
.\provision.ps1
```

Reads `VmProvisionerConfig` from the vault and for each VM definition:

1. Validates all required fields.
2. Skips the entry if a Hyper-V VM with the same `vmName` already exists
   (idempotent re-runs are safe).
3. Aborts the entry if `ipAddress` responds to a ping (prevents static-IP
   conflicts with existing machines).
4. Downloads the Ubuntu cloud image (`.vhd.tar.gz`) from the Ubuntu CDN into
   `vhdPath` once per `ubuntuVersion`, converts it to `.vhdx`, and caches it.
   On first download it also patches the base image via WSL2 to enable the
   NoCloud cloud-init datasource (required for Hyper-V — the Azure image ships
   with Azure-only datasource config). Subsequent runs reuse the cached,
   patched base image — no re-download or re-patch.
5. Copies the base image to a per-VM disk (`{vmName}.vhdx`) and resizes it
   to `diskGB`.
6. Runs host-side acquisitions for each VM via a small per-VM orchestrator
   (`Invoke-VmAcquisitions`). Today it dispatches one acquirer:
   - **`javaDevKit`** acquires the requested Temurin tarball into
     `vhdPath` (see [Optional: install a JDK](#optional-install-a-jdk)).

   Skipped silently for VMs that have no opt-in fields. New acquirers
   plug in as one dispatch line in the orchestrator, not a new step
   here.
7. Generates a cloud-init seed ISO (`{vmName}-seed.iso`) in `vmConfigPath`
   containing `meta-data`, `user-data`, and `network-config`. On first boot
   cloud-init reads the ISO to create the OS user, enable SSH, and apply the
   static IP - no interactive installer needed.
8. Creates a Hyper-V Internal switch named `VmLAN` (if absent),
   assigns the `gateway` IP to the host-side virtual NIC, and adds a
   `New-NetNat` rule for the subnet so VMs can reach the internet through
   the host. The host reaches VMs at their static IPs via the same vNIC.
9. Creates each VM (Gen 2, static RAM, VHDX from step 5), sets Secure Boot
   to `MicrosoftUEFICertificateAuthority` (required for Ubuntu), attaches
   the seed ISO, connects to `VmLAN`, and starts the VM. Polls port 22
   until cloud-init finishes, then detaches and deletes the seed ISO.
10. For each VM, runs post-provisioning. Opens one host file server and
    one SSH session per VM, waits once for cloud-init to finish, then
    dispatches each enabled step:
    - **`files`** copies host files to declared VM paths
      (see [Optional: copy files to the VM](#optional-copy-files-to-the-vm)).
    - **`javaDevKit`** extracts the prefetched Temurin tarball into
      `/opt/jdk-{vendor}-{resolvedVersion}/` and writes
      `/etc/profile.d/jdk.sh`
      (see [Optional: install a JDK](#optional-install-a-jdk)).

    Each step is self-contained — no step consumes files left by another
    step. Adding a new step (e.g. Maven) is a one-function addition with
    one dispatch line in `Invoke-VmPostProvisioning`. Skipped silently
    for VMs that have no opt-in fields.

---

## deprovision.ps1

Run as Administrator to remove VMs that were created by `provision.ps1`.

```powershell
.\deprovision.ps1
```

Reads the same `VmProvisionerConfig` from the vault and for each VM definition:

1. Validates all required fields.
2. Stops the VM if running, then removes it from Hyper-V. If the VM is already
   absent (re-run after a partial failure), the Hyper-V step is skipped and
   only file cleanup is attempted.
3. Deletes the per-VM VHDX (`{vmName}.vhdx`) in `vhdPath`. If Windows VMMS
   still holds a handle after `Remove-VM`, deletion is retried up to 5 times
   at 2-second intervals. If the file is still locked after all retries the
   script throws with the path identified — re-running after a few seconds
   retries the deletion.
4. Deletes the seed ISO (`{vmName}-seed.iso`) in `vmConfigPath` if present.
   `provision.ps1` removes it after first boot, so absence is not an error.
5. Deletes the VM configuration directory (`{vmConfigPath}/{vmName}/`) if
   present, with the same retry logic as the VHDX.

After all VMs are processed:

6. Removes the `VmLAN-NAT` NAT rule, the gateway IP from the host vNIC, and
   the `VmLAN` Internal switch — but only when no VMs remain connected to the
   switch. If VMs outside the config are still attached (e.g. provisioned
   separately), the network teardown is skipped to preserve their connectivity.

**The base Ubuntu image is not deleted.** It is shared across all VMs of the
same Ubuntu version and is not specific to any single config entry. Delete it
manually from `vhdPath` if it is no longer needed.

---

## CI

CI runs on pull requests targeting `master` via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`,
which delegates to the shared reusable workflow in
[Infrastructure-Common](https://github.com/VitaliiAndreev/Infrastructure-Common):

```
VitaliiAndreev/Infrastructure-Common/.github/workflows/ci-powershell.yml@master
```

The shared workflow runs `Run-Tests.ps1` on PowerShell 7.
No additional CI configuration is needed in this repo.

Each scenario follows the `hypervisor/guest-os/` convention. Future scenarios
(e.g. `hyper-v/windows-server/`, `vmware/ubuntu/`) extend the tree without
changing the root structure. Each scenario folder is self-contained — its own
scripts, its own secrets setup, its own README if needed.

**Recommended specs for a self-hosted GitHub Actions runner:**

| Disk     | 40 GB  | Covers Ubuntu base (~5 GB), runner agent, Docker image cache, and workspace        |
| OS       | 24.04  | Current LTS; matches the `ubuntu-24.04` GitHub-hosted runner label for parity     |
